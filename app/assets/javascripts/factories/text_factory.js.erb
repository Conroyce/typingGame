    "Craig watched the sunlight slowly fade away. He closed his eyes and relaxed his tensed shoulders. He felt himself slowly drift into the abyss.",
    'We used to play pretend, give each other different names. We would build a rocket ship and then we\'d fly it far away. Used to dream of outer space but now they\'re laughing at our face, saying, â€œwake up, you need to make money."',

No see you later. No nothing. You just left. I don't know much, but I know that.",
    'As Mr. Sloan always says, there is no "I" in team, but there is an "I" in pie. And there\'s an "I" in meat pie. Anagram of meat is team... I don\'t know what he\'s talking about.',
    "I'm burning through the sky yeah! Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit. I'm traveling at the speed of light; I wanna make a supersonic man out of you.",
    "Some legends are told, some turn to dust or to gold. But you will remember me, remember me for centuries. And just one mistake, is all it will take. We'll go down in history, remember me for centuries."
